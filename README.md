# Python-100DaysChallange
I'm gonna start learn python from nothing for 100 days.
everyday i'm gonna upload what i have learn by the end of the day.
in the end of the 100 days, i will make a big program of all the thing i learned in the past 100 days.

The Rules are:
1. I need to learn at least 1 hour per day, than i need to finish what i have started in the end of the hour and stop.
2. The only way to skip a day is if i don't have at list an hour per day to learn, if i skip a day i have to pay it up and learn for 2 hours the next possible day.
